# Spotify Song Discoverer

## Introduction
During big parts of my days I listen to music through Spotify and I'm always on the search for something new. Spotify do today generate quite a lot of recommended songs, with features like the "Discover weekly" and "Release Radar" playlists but I though that i should try it out myself and see if what whose algorithms work the best. I also saw it as a fun opportunity to improve my python and ML skills as well as learn how to handle APIs while at the same time build something which is accually useful to me. 

### Special Acknowledgment
Thanks to Spotify both for providing a great service and for providing__ an easy-to-use web API with helpful guides.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to create a classifier which, based on my recent listening history, will recommend me songs. 

My plan was to collect all the song which I've listen to during the last week. Rank them by most played artist and choose the top 10. Then choose each of these artists top 10 related artists. This gives 100 profiles too choose from. From these i pick their top 10 most popular songs  to my dataset of possible songs. 1000 in total, minus a few dupicates and some which filters away because they are on the list of what iäve listen to durnig the week.
